## What is a Capivara?

The capivara (or capybara) is the largest rodent in the world. Native to South America, these semi-aquatic mammals are known for their friendly and social nature. They are often found in groups near bodies of water, where they graze on grasses and aquatic plants. Capybaras are highly adaptable and can be seen in a variety of habitats, from dense forests to open grasslands.

Their relaxed demeanor and unique appearance have made them a popular subject in various forms of media and culture.
